# 29-beginner-JavaScript-projects

29 JavaScript beginner projects, that I did on December of 2020 when I was done with the tutorial from Udemy (The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2021) by: Colt Steele &amp; Stephen Grider) and I started to build projects by myself.

All the projects ideas are from: https://jsbeginners.com/.
