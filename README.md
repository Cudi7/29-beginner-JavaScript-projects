# 29-beginner-JavaScript-projects

29 JavaScript beginner projects, that I did on December of 2020 when I was done with the tutorial from Udemy (The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2021) by: Colt Steele &amp; Stephen Grider) and I started to build projects by myself.

These are all JS related projects so all the HTML or CSS was given.

If you wish to check first what all these mini projects do, please visit https://jsbeginners.com/, all the ideas are from there.
